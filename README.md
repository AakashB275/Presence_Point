## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. User Identification  
Users are identified based on predefined inputs (e.g., name, ID, or input prompt).

### 2. Presence Logging  
Attendance data is recorded with relevant metadata such as time or session.

### 3. Data Storage  
Presence information is stored locally (file/database depending on implementation).

### 4. Retrieval & Analysis  
Stored data can be accessed for tracking, verification, or analysis.
